          Hi there! My name is Nicole. I am an undergraduate pursuing a dual
          degree in computer science and art & design at the University of
          Michigan-Ann Arbor. I explore and build new ways to combine both
          disciplines of engineering and art to create pleasurable experiences
          for the user and promote humanity in the age of technology.
        </p>

          This is reflected in my projects where they center around the
          wellbeing of the user. For example, using mixed reality to create a
          detailed visualization of the pain points to help the users
          communicate their illness better and augmented reality to promote
          users’ wellbeing through nurturing virtual plants.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m currently focused on XR development, game development, digital
          animations, and learning artificial intelligence, computer vision, and
          UX/UI of web pages. As a game developer at AiR Play. I designed and
          developed a new AR-projector based game using C# in Unity for the
          launch of iGYM, AiR Play’s AR system to be launched to schools and
          recreational facilities. I also enjoy learning and exploring
          artificial intelligence. As a research scholar at Google’s Computer
          Science Research Program, I work with a Google mentor in achieving new
          research pathways in combination with virtual reality and artificial
          intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not working, I love solo traveling, exploring new
          restaurants, drawing digital art, skiing, and playing video games!
