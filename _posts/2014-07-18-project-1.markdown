description: Daily Daisies is Alternate Reality Initiative’s year-long project where members developed and designed an augmented reality wellness app. The app aims to promote the user’s wellbeing through a generation of weekly and daily wellness tasks to nurture a collection of augmented reality plants. I guided members to design the user interface and gamification features to improve the wellness app’s user experience and encourage users to take care of their virtual plants often.
